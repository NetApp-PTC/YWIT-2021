\chapter{Introduction}
This workshop will introduce the student to Python coding, electronics, and project
design. We will building several projects ranging from simple to complicated. These
projects are based on the ESP8266 microcontroller which is running MicroPython and
they depend on some other electronics components such as LEDs, buttons, and more.
